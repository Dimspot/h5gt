About
=====

There are several C++ wrappers for `HDF5 <https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hdf5/>`_ 
C library. 
One of them is `HighFive <https://github.com/BlueBrain/HighFive>`_ project.
**h5gt** is created upon it.
So the API is pretty similar.

Generally one may prefer using **h5gt** only if python bindings are needed.
Otherwise one should consider using `HighFive <https://github.com/BlueBrain/HighFive>`_.

Originally the project was started as part of a free and open source geophysical platform 
`Colada <https://github.com/tierra-colada/Colada>`_.

Also `h5geo <https://github.com/tierra-colada/h5geo>`_ project
actively uses **h5gt**.
